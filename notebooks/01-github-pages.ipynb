    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules for transferring files (such as text, images, and audio) on the World Wide Web. HTTP enables communication between different systems, allowing clients (such as a web browser) to send requests to servers (such as a web server) and receive responses.\n",

    "###  What is a server?\n",
    "In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called \"clients\". This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called \"services\", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.\n",

    "##  Static vs Dynamic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of web development, static websites are those that do not change their content based on user input or other changing factors. The content of a static website is fixed and does not change unless the website owner manually updates it. On the other hand, dynamic websites are those that can change their content based on user input or other changing factors. The content of a dynamic website is generated in real-time, often using information stored in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between static and dynamic websites is the level of interactivity they offer to users. Static websites are generally less interactive, as they do not allow users to input data or interact with the website in any meaningful way. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, often allow users to input data and interact with the website in various ways, such as by filling out forms, leaving comments, or voting in polls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between static and dynamic websites is the level of complexity involved in creating and maintaining them. Static websites are generally simpler to create and maintain, as they do not require the use of a server-side language or a database. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, often require the use of a server-side language such as PHP or ASP.NET, as well as a database to store and retrieve data. This added complexity makes dynamic websites more challenging to create and maintain, but also allows for greater flexibility and functionality.\n",
